        "elaboration": "This does not necessarily mean exposing the entire algorithmic code, but providing insights into the 'why' behind a decision (e.g., key features, rule-based logic if applicable, risk scores). The level of detail should be proportionate to the impact.",

        "elaboration": "This allows users to verify information and understand its provenance. For generative AI, this might mean identifying training data influences or source documents if directly citing.",
