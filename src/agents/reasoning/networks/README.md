# Probabilistic Graphical Models: A Curated Collection

This repository provides a comprehensive set of **Bayesian Networks (BNs)** and **Grid-based Networks** in JSON format. These models are designed for testing, benchmarking, and developing probabilistic reasoning systems, from simple causal chains to large-scale spatial grids.

## Key Features

- **Standardized Format**: All networks are defined in a clean, easy-to-parse JSON structure.
- **Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)**: Every network is guaranteed to be a DAG, suitable for probabilistic inference.
- **Binary Variables**: Nodes represent binary (True/False) random variables for straightforward implementation.
- **Defined Probabilities**: Each model includes a complete set of Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs) or prior probabilities.
- **Rich Metadata**: Complex networks include descriptions, dependency types, and complexity factors to guide selection.

## How to Choose a Network

To select the right model for your task, first ask:

1.  **Is my problem about causal or logical relationships?**
    - **Yes**: Your problem involves cause-and-effect, diagnosis, or abstract reasoning. **Use a Bayesian Network.**
    - **No**: Your problem is primarily spatial, structural, or involves interactions between adjacent entities (like pixels or sensors). **Use a Grid Network.**

2.  **What is the scale of my problem?**
    - Start with the smallest network that fits your conceptual model (e.g., a simple chain, fork, or 2x2 grid).
    - Increase complexity to test scalability, performance, and the robustness of your inference algorithms.

## üîó Bayesian Networks (For Causal & Logical Reasoning)

Bayesian Networks model probabilistic relationships between variables. They are ideal for tasks like root cause analysis, diagnostics, and modeling systems where variables have distinct, semantic meanings.

## Grid Networks (For Spatial & Structural Reasoning)

Grid Networks are a special type of Bayesian Network where nodes are arranged in a 2D lattice. Each node's state is conditionally dependent on its immediate neighbors (typically the ones above and to the left). They are perfect for modeling spatial phenomena.

## Usage Example

The networks can be loaded and used with a library like `pgmpy` or a custom Python wrapper. The following demonstrates a typical query using the provided `probabilistic_models.py` class, which encapsulates the logic.

1.  **Initialize the Model**: This loads the default network and knowledge base.
    ```python
    from probabilistic_models import ProbabilisticModels
    model = ProbabilisticModels()
    ```

2.  **Select a Network (Optional)**: Choose a network based on your task requirements.
    ```python
    # Select a network for a medium-complexity contextual reasoning task
    network_file = model.select_network(
        task_type="contextual_reasoning",
        complexity="medium",
        speed_requirement="balanced"
    )
    model.bayesian_network = model._load_bayesian_network(Path(network_file))
    ```

3.  **Run Queries**: Perform inference by providing a query variable and evidence.
    ```python
    # Query node 'H' with evidence that 'A' is True and 'C' is False
    probability = model.bayesian_inference(
        query="H", 
        evidence={"A": True, "C": False}
    )
    print(f"The probability is: {probability}")
    ```
