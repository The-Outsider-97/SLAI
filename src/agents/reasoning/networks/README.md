# üß† Probabilistic Graphical Models: Bayesian and Grid Networks

This repository contains examples and utilities for working with **Bayesian Networks** and **Grid-based Bayesian Networks**, modeled as probabilistic graphical structures using `pgmpy`.

## üìå What Are Bayesian Networks?

**Bayesian Networks (BNs)** are **directed acyclic graphs** (DAGs) where:
- **Nodes** represent random variables.
- **Edges** represent conditional dependencies.
- **Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs)** encode the probabilities associated with each node, given its parents.

They allow efficient reasoning about uncertainty using probabilistic inference.

### Example: Custom Bayesian Network
This file: [`bayesian_network.json`](./bayesian_network.json)

#### Structure:
- 8 nodes: A ‚Üí H
- Mixed dependencies (AND, OR, hierarchical)
- CPTs define how each variable behaves given its parents

#### Highlights:
- Multi-parent nodes (e.g. D, G, H)
- Hierarchical causal layers
- Feedback and mediated paths

## üî≥ What Are Grid Networks?

**Grid Bayesian Networks** are structured as a 2D grid (like a lattice). Each node:
- Represents a local variable (e.g., pixel, cell, sensor).
- Depends on neighbors (e.g., left, top).

These networks are commonly used for:
- **Image denoising**
- **Sensor networks**
- **Terrain modeling**
- **Spatio-temporal inference**

Each of these networks has:
- Binary-valued nodes
- Priors or conditional CPTs based on 1 or 2 neighbors
- Strictly acyclic edges (e.g., top-down, left-right)

## üßÆ How Inference Works

1. **Load Network** from JSON using your wrapper class.
2. **Compile Model**: Define nodes, edges, and CPTs in `pgmpy`.
3. **Run Queries** using variable elimination:
   ```python
   pbn.query("H", {"A": True, "C": False})
