**Explanation and Integration:**

1.  **File Structure:** Save this code as `cyber_safety.py` within the same directory as `safety_agent.py` (e.g., `src/agents/safety/cyber_safety.py`).
2.  **Class `CyberSafetyModule`:** Encapsulates the cyber security logic.
3.  **Initialization (`__init__`)**:
    * Takes optional `config`, `shared_memory`, and `agent_factory` for consistency with the agent architecture.
    * Loads extended security rules (patterns, principles) potentially from a JSON file specified in the config. Includes defaults if no file is found.
    * Initializes components for statistical and sequence-based anomaly detection using `deque` and `defaultdict`.
    * Includes a flag (`use_qnn_inspired`) and placeholders for integrating quantum-inspired anomaly detection concepts (using NumPy for vector math).
    * Loads basic vulnerability signatures (expandable).
4.  **Input Analysis (`analyze_input`)**:
    * Takes arbitrary input data and a context string.
    * Performs multi-layered analysis:
        * Matches against loaded regex patterns (`security_rules`).
        * Matches against known vulnerability signatures.
        * Applies simple context-based heuristics.
    * Calculates a risk score based on the severity of findings.
    * Generates recommendations linked to security principles.
5.  **Event Stream Analysis (`analyze_event_stream`)**:
    * Processes structured events (like logs).
    * Updates statistical profiles (mean, std dev) for numerical features to detect statistical anomalies (Z-score).
    * Tracks sequences of events per user to detect unusual patterns (currently a simplified check).
    * Includes conceptual integration for **QNN-inspired anomaly detection**:
        * `_map_to_feature_vector`: Converts event features into a NumPy vector.
        * `_simulate_qnn_anomaly`: *Simulates* calculating an anomaly score based on the distance of the current event's vector from a learned 'normal' state representation (centroid). This uses NumPy for vector math (dot product, norm) and includes a basic adaptive learning step where the centroid shifts slightly towards the current event vector. This mimics the adaptive learning concept. The distance calculation is analogous to what a quantum distance metric or clustering algorithm might compute in a feature space.
    * Combines scores from different methods (statistical, sequential, QNN-inspired) to determine if an event is anomalous.
6.  **Threat Assessment (`generate_threat_assessment`)**:
    * Provides a basic STRIDE-like threat modeling capability based on contextual information about a component or action.
7.  **Dependencies:** Primarily uses native Python libraries (`logging`, `re`, `json`, `math`, `hashlib`, `time`, `random`, `collections`, `typing`, `pathlib`) and `numpy` for numerical/vector operations, fitting the requirements.
8.  **Integration with `SafetyAgent`:**
    * In `safety_agent.py`, you would:
        * Import `CyberSafetyModule`: `from .cyber_safety import CyberSafetyModule`
        * Instantiate it in `SafeAI_Agent.__init__`, passing relevant config and shared memory:
            ```python
            # Inside SafeAI_Agent.__init__
            cyber_config = config.get('cyber_safety_config', {}) # Get config from main agent config
            self.cyber_safety_module = CyberSafetyModule(
                config=cyber_config,
                shared_memory=self.shared_memory,
                agent_factory=self.agent_factory
            )
            ```
        * Call its methods within `SafeAI_Agent.validate_action` or a similar validation/analysis point:
            ```python
            # Inside SafeAI_Agent.validate_action(self, action: Dict) -> Dict:
            # ... existing validation ...

            # Add cyber safety analysis
            # Determine context and relevant data from 'action' dict
            input_to_analyze = action.get('parameters', str(action)) # Example: analyze parameters
            context = action.get('type', 'general_action') # Example: use action type as context

            cyber_analysis = self.cyber_safety_module.analyze_input(input_to_analyze, context=context)
            validation['cyber_risk_score'] = cyber_analysis['risk_score']
            validation['cyber_findings'] = cyber_analysis['findings']

            if cyber_analysis['risk_score'] > self.config.risk_thresholds.get("security", 0.1): # Use security threshold
                 validation["approved"] = False
                 # Add cyber-specific recommendations to corrections
                 correction_details = {
                     "source": "CyberSafetyModule",
                     "reason": f"High cyber risk score ({cyber_analysis['risk_score']:.2f})",
                     "recommendations": cyber_analysis['recommendations']
                 }
                 # Append or merge these details into validation['corrections']
                 # validation["corrections"].append(self.apply_cyber_corrections(correction_details)) # Need apply_cyber_corrections logic

            # If analyzing event streams (e.g., monitoring agent actions):
            # event_data = self._create_event_from_action(action) # Convert action to event format
            # anomaly_result = self.cyber_safety_module.analyze_event_stream(event_data)
            # if anomaly_result['is_anomaly']:
            #     # Trigger alert or specific handling
            #     self._trigger_alert("high", f"Cyber Anomaly Detected: {anomaly_result['reason']}")
            #     validation["approved"] = False # Optionally block based on anomaly

            # ... rest of validate_action ...
            ```
9.  **Configuration (`config.yaml`)**: You might add a section for the cyber module under `agent-network.safety.init_args`:
    ```yaml
    agent-network:
      safety:
        class: SafeAI_Agent
        path: src.agents.safety_agent
        init_args:
          # ... existing args (constitutional_rules, risk_threshold, etc.) ...
          cyber_safety_config: # New section for the sub-module
            rules_path: "src/agents/safety/cyber_security_rules.json" # Optional extended rules
            anomaly_threshold: 2.8
            max_log_history: 1500
            qnn_inspired_anomaly: true
            qnn_feature_dim: 16
          # ...
    ```

This structure integrates the cyber safety functionality as a dedicated module within the safety agent, leveraging native capabilities and concepts from the adaptive/QNN agents as requested, while maintaining consistency with the overall architecture. Remember to create the `cyber_security_rules.json` file if you specify a path for it.
Okay, I have created the `cyber_safety.py` file as requested. Here's a breakdown of how it meets your requirements and integrates with the existing architecture:

1.  **File Structure and Purpose:**
    * The file is named `cyber_safety.py` and contains a `CyberSafetyModule` class.
    * It's designed to be a specialized sub-module focusing on cyber safety analysis, threat detection, and anomaly detection, intended to be used by the main `SafeAI_Agent` in `safety_agent.py`.

2.  **Content Focus (Cyber Safety & Security):**
    * **Input Analysis:** Includes methods (`analyze_input`) to check input data against configurable security rule patterns (e.g., sensitive keywords, weak passwords, injection attempts) and basic vulnerability signatures.
    * **Threat Modeling:** Provides a basic STRIDE-based threat assessment (`generate_threat_assessment`) based on contextual information about system components or actions.
    * **Event Stream Analysis:** Implements `analyze_event_stream` to detect anomalies in sequences of events using:
        * Statistical methods (z-score on numerical features).
        * Basic sequence pattern analysis (tracking event type sequences per user).

3.  **QNN and Adaptive Agent Integration:**
    * **Adaptive Concepts:** The event stream analysis incorporates adaptive learning principles:
        * Statistical thresholds adapt as more data is processed (mean/std dev calculation).
        * The conceptual QNN anomaly detection includes an adaptive centroid (`qnn_state_representation`) that slowly learns the 'normal' feature space based on incoming events. This mirrors the learning approach in `adaptive_agent.py`.
    * **QNN-Inspired Concepts:**
        * Includes an optional (`qnn_inspired_anomaly` flag) method (`_simulate_qnn_anomaly`) that uses NumPy to *simulate* a quantum-inspired anomaly detection process.
        * This involves mapping event features to a vector (`_map_to_feature_vector`) and calculating a distance metric (cosine distance) in a conceptual feature space, mimicking techniques like QSVM or quantum distance calculations without requiring actual quantum libraries, aligning with the principles in `qnn_agent.py`.

4.  **Dependencies and Implementation:**
    * Relies primarily on native Python libraries (`logging`, `re`, `json`, `math`, `hashlib`, `time`, `random`, `collections`, `typing`, `pathlib`) and `numpy` for mathematical/statistical operations, fulfilling the requirement to minimize external libraries.
    * Draws on academic concepts like STRIDE, statistical anomaly detection, and conceptual QML.

5.  **Architectural Consistency and Redundancy:**
    * The `CyberSafetyModule` class structure fits within the agent-based architecture.
    * It complements the existing `SafetyGuard` by providing more advanced analysis beyond simple redaction/toxicity filtering.
    * It complements the `constitutional_rules.json` by focusing on *dynamic analysis* (event streams, anomaly detection) and specific *patterns/signatures*, while the constitutional rules provide high-level principles. The module allows loading extended rules to specialize beyond the constitution.
    * It avoids direct interaction with `slai_lm`, keeping its focus specialized.

**Next Steps for Integration:**

1.  **Modify `safety_agent.py`:**
    * Import `CyberSafetyModule` from `cyber_safety.py`.
    * Instantiate `CyberSafetyModule` within the `SafeAI_Agent.__init__` method, passing relevant config and shared memory.
    * Call methods like `cyber_module.analyze_input()` within `SafeAI_Agent.validate_action()` or a similar validation step.
    * Feed relevant events (if available) to `cyber_module.analyze_event_stream()` possibly triggered by the `AlignmentMonitor` or other hooks.
    * Use `cyber_module.generate_threat_assessment()` when evaluating plans or system changes.
2.  **Update `config.yaml`:**
    * Add a configuration section under `agent-network.safety.init_args` (or a dedicated `cyber_safety` sub-key) for the `CyberSafetyModule`.
    * Include parameters like `rules_path` (for custom cyber rules), `anomaly_threshold`, `max_log_history`, and `qnn_inspired_anomaly`.
