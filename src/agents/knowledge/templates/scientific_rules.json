    "description": "The Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics establishes the concept of temperature and thermal equilibrium. It states that if two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third system, then they are in thermal equilibrium with each other. This principle underpins the ability to measure temperature and is fundamental in the study and application of thermodynamics.",

    "description": "The First Law of Thermodynamics, also known as the Law of Conservation of Energy, states that energy cannot be created or destroyed in an isolated system. Energy can only be transformed from one form to another, ensuring the total energy remains constant. This principle underpins much of physical science, from classical mechanics to chemical reactions.",

    "description": "Newton's First Law of Motion, also known as the Law of Inertia, states that an object will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force. It underscores the relationship between the motion of an object and the forces acting upon it, serving as a cornerstone in classical mechanics.",

    "description": "The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that the total entropy of an isolated system can never decrease over time, and is constant if and only if all processes are reversible. It signifies that heat cannot spontaneously flow from a colder location to a hotter area without adding work, and it provides a fundamental criterion for the direction of spontaneous processes.",
