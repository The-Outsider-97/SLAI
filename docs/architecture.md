# Self-Improving AI - System Architecture

## Components
1. **Agents**: Build/train/evolve neural networks.
2. **Evaluators**: Assess model performance and decide which models continue evolving.
3. **Main Loop (main.py)**: Orchestrates the agent's actions, trains models, evaluates them, and iterates.

## Roadmap
- Stage 1: Evolutionary agent with basic mutation of architectures.
- Stage 2: Reinforcement learning integration.
- Stage 3: Meta-learning capability.
