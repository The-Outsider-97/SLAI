# SLAI - Self-Learning Autonomous Intelligence

An open-source AGI prototype that evolves, learns, and rewrites itself.
SLAI combines **Reinforcement Learning**, **Meta-Learning**, and **Recursive Self-Improvement** into an autonomous research agent.

---

## What It Does
- Evolves deep neural networks (AutoML / NAS)  
- Reinforcement learning agents (DQN, PPO)  
- Meta-learning agents (MAML, Reptile) for few-shot task adaptation  
- Recursive self-improvement: code generation, evaluation, and rewriting  
- Multi-task RL framework  
- Sandbox execution for safety  

---

# How to run

## Clone this repo.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/The-Outsider-97/SLAI.git
   cd SLAI
   ```

2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended):

On **Linux/MacOS**:
   ```console
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate        # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

On **Windows (PowerShell)**:
   ```console
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   ```

Note: If you see an error about execution policy:
   ```console
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
   .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   ```
3. Install requirements:

   ```console
   pip install torch
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install argparse
   pip install seaborn
   pip install scikit-optimize
   ```
Optional: For CUDA (GPU), install PyTorch with the correct CUDA version. See: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/

4. Run a basic reinforcement learning task (CartPole with DQN):

   ```console
   python main_cartpole.py
   ```

5. Run Evolutionary Hyperparameter Optimization (CartPole + Evolution):

   ```console
   python main_cartpole_evolve.py
   ```

6. Run multi-task learning agent:

   ```console
   python main_multitask.py
   ```

7. Run Meta-Learning (MAML):):

   ```console
   python main_maml.py
   ```

8. Run Meta-Learning (MAML):):
Docker is required for sandboxing.
Start Docker daemon first.

   ```console
   python main_rsi.py
   ```

## Continuous Integration
- GitHub Actions workflow runs on each push/PR.
- To trigger manually:
  ```bash
  gh workflow run test.yml
   ```

   If user experiencing errors at this stage, run this command to install PyTorch inside the virtual environment.
   CPU-Only Version (lighter):

   ```console
   pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
   ```

   Confirm Torch Installed:

   ```console
   pip list
   ```
   
6. Run the Tests (Optional but Recommended):

   ```console
   pytest tests/
   ```

## Roadmap
- [x] Basic evolutionary agent
- [x] Multi-Task RL with shared policies
- [x] Meta-Learning (MAML / Reptile)
- [x] Recursive Self-Improvement (Codegen + Evaluation Loop)
- [x] Safe AI & Alignment Checks

## SLAI v1.5 — Modular, Collaborative, and Visual

**Release Date:** March 2025  
**Branch:** `SLAI-v.1.5`

### 🔍 Goals

- Build a fully modular system to support:
  - Collaborative agent architecture with task routing
  - Automated research and development loop
  - Frontend interface for real-time monitoring and agent control

---

### ✅ Key Features

#### 1. Collaborative Agents & Task Routing
- Dynamic agent registry with capability tagging
- TaskRouter with fallback handling and success-based ranking
- Shared memory architecture for knowledge transfer
- Agent interface standardization (`execute(task_data)`)

#### 2. Automated R&D Loop
- Modular pipeline for hyperparameter tuning, experiment management, and evaluation
- Grid search with integrated evaluator and model registry
- Centralized metrics logging (F1, accuracy, risk score, etc.)
- Top agent auto-registration after tuning

#### 3. Frontend Visualization
- Flask-based frontend replicating terminal-style UI
- Real-time log streaming via `/logs`
- Live metric updates via `/metrics`
- Agent dropdown launcher with backend subprocess support
- Modular components (`window_controls`, `metrics_box`, `buttons`)

---

### 📦 Backend Modules

| Folder            | Description                                         |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `agents/`         | All agent classes (DQN, MAML, RSI, SafeAI, etc.)   |
| `collaborative/`  | Registry, task router, shared memory               |
| `rnd_loop/`       | Evaluator, experiment manager, hyperparam tuner    |
| `modules/`        | Monitoring, logging, compliance, training, security |
| `deployment/`     | Model registry, inference API, batch processing    |
| `frontend/`       | Templates, styles, and visual interface components |

---

### 🧠 Intelligence Infrastructure

- Real-time `logger.py` with queue integration
- Monitoring logs pushed to frontend terminal
- Shared memory supports inter-agent communication
- Evaluation results feed back into tuning and registry

---

### 🧪 How to Run

```bash
# Launch the web frontend
python app.py

# Launch an agent manually
python main_safe_ai.py
```

# SLAI v1.6 Roadmap

**Milestone Focus:**  
Moving from modular execution to autonomous collaboration and introspection.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

1. Enable agents to:
   - Analyze their own performance
   - Propose changes to hyperparameters or policies

2. Build a persistent experiment memory:
   - Evaluation history
   - Configs, scores, and logs over time

3. Expand frontend to support:
   - Live experiment management
   - Leaderboards and real-time comparisons
   - Security/compliance logs display

---

|--------|---------|
| `agent_introspector.py` | Let agents self-reflect on failure conditions |
| `scoreboard.py` | Central registry of all agent scores |
| `session_manager.py` | Save, restore, and replay sessions |

---

## 🚀 Timeline Suggestion

| Week | Goals |
|------|-------|
| Week 1 | Build `scoreboard` + enable live leaderboard UI |
| Week 2 | Add introspection hooks to top 3 agents |
| Week 3 | Enable persistent evaluation logging (DB or JSONL) |
| Week 4 | UI upgrade: views for logs, scores, history, toggles |

---

## 📝 Notes

- All new modules should integrate with:
  - `shared_memory`
  - `logger.py`
  - `evaluator.py`
- Focus on reusable interfaces so agents can plug in different types of self-analysis logic
- Prioritize UI clarity: avoid clutter, maintain 2-panel simplicity
