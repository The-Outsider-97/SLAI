# Self-Improving AI

An open-source experiment in building an AI that evolves its own models.

## What it does
- Evolves simple neural networks.
- Evaluates performance.
- Iterates improvements over generations.

## How to run
1. Clone this repo.
   - git clone https://github.com/The-Outsider-97/SLAI.git
2. Install requirements:
   - pip install torch
3. Run the main loop:
   - python main.py


## Roadmap
- [x] Basic evolutionary agent
- [ ] Add reinforcement learning agents
- [ ] Implement meta-learning strategy
- [ ] Build interactive dashboard for monitoring
