## What is SLAI?

SLAI is a modular, distributed AI assistant framework composed of autonomous agents. It decomposes complex tasks into specialized processes handled by modular agents. Each agent is specialized (e.g., perception, planning, reasoning) and collectively they:

- Process multimodal user input (text, voice, images)
- Retrieve and validate knowledge from memory and external sources
- Plan and execute complex tasks using tools or APIs
- Perform logical reasoning and generate fluent natural language responses
- Ensure output safety, ethical alignment, and continual improvement via learning
- Adapt over time through user feedback, monitoring, and meta-learning

   ```console
   python main_cartpole_evolve.py
   ```

6. Run multi-task learning agent:

   ```console
   python main_multitask.py
   ```

7. Run Meta-Learning (MAML):):

   ```console
   python main_maml.py
   ```

8. Run Meta-Learning (MAML):):
Docker is required for sandboxing.
Start Docker daemon first.

   ```console
   python main_rsi.py
   ```

## Continuous Integration
- GitHub Actions workflow runs on each push/PR.
- To trigger manually:
  ```bash
  gh workflow run test.yml
   ```

   If user experiencing errors at this stage, run this command to install PyTorch inside the virtual environment.
   CPU-Only Version (lighter):

   ```console
   pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
   ```

   Confirm Torch Installed:

   ```console
   pip list
   ```
   
6. Run the Tests (Optional but Recommended):

   ```console
   pytest tests/
   ```

## Roadmap
- [x] Basic evolutionary agent
- [x] Multi-Task RL with shared policies
- [x] Meta-Learning (MAML / Reptile)
- [x] Recursive Self-Improvement (Codegen + Evaluation Loop)
- [x] Safe AI & Alignment Checks

1. Enable agents to:
   - Analyze their own performance
   - Propose changes to hyperparameters or policies

2. Build a persistent experiment memory:
   - Evaluation history
   - Configs, scores, and logs over time

3. Expand frontend to support:
   - Live experiment management
   - Leaderboards and real-time comparisons
   - Security/compliance logs display

## üöÄ Timeline Suggestion

| Week | Goals |
|------|-------|
| Week 1 | Build `scoreboard` + enable live leaderboard UI |

## üìù Notes

- All new modules should integrate with:
  - `shared_memory`
  - `logger.py`
